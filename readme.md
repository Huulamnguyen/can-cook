# Capstone Proposal

## Project Name: Inventory Management System

## 1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

As a member of a retailer in New York. I experienced difficulty managing inventory without using any technology. My capstone project focuses on building an inventory management system by using web development to help retailers manage their inventory efficiently and accurately.
My idea is inspired by a cloud application named VEND, which is a big inventory management system software in New Zealand. You can find more at [VENDHQ.com] (https://www.vendhq.com/) and images below.
